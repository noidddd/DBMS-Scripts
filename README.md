# DBMS-Scripts

This repository contains the Node.js scripts that were used to query the MongoDB cluster.

Note that the scripts require a unique connection string to interact with the cluster.
E.g. in the code:

const uri = "connection-string";

The value inside "" would be replaced with the unique key.
